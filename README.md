# Text Analysis Classwork

This is a collection of scripts/reports written for my text analysis class. The class was taught by Marshall A. Taylor. 

## Info for visitors

I've kept this repo public so individuals who are interested in learning more about conducting text analysis with R can explore the techniques herein. However: **please do not explore my R scripts to evalute my programming competency.** I wrote these while I was unfamiliar with a lot of programming best practices; consequently, a lot of these scripts are computationally inefficient. While most are still well-organized and documented, they do not reflect how I would solve the provided problems today.
